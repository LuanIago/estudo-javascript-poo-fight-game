# 🗡️ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Study in JavaScript – Battle System

A practical project developed to apply fundamental **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts using **JavaScript**, through the simulation of a battle between characters.

---

## 📌 About the Project

In this exercise, a small “game” was developed in which two characters attack each other, with dynamic health bar updates and on-screen action logging.

The main goal was to **reinforce OOP concepts** by transforming theory into practice in a clear and well-structured way.

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Applied

- Classes and objects
- Object instantiation
- Inheritance
- Encapsulation
- `get` and `set` methods
- Code reuse
- Base class modeling

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Character attack system
- Dynamic damage and defense calculation
- Visual health bar updates
- Battle action log
- Attribute validation using getters and setters

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3

---

## 🎯 Exercise Objective

To practice and consolidate the main Object-Oriented Programming concepts in JavaScript, focusing on organization, code reuse, and logical clarity.

---

## 🚀 Key Learnings

This exercise represented an important challenge in my learning journey, requiring attention to detail and logical reasoning to properly structure classes, methods, and object interactions.

With guidance from **Bonieky Lacerda (B7Web)**, I was able to develop the solution by applying best practices and reinforcing essential OOP concepts.
